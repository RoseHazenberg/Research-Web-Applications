about.section=7KX4 prevents the entry of the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus cell. Cream-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus is a tick-borne virus that can cause life-threatening illness and even death in humans. The geographic range of the tick vector determines disease occurrence, and climate change may expand this range. Infection of host cells necessitates the presence of the fusion glycoprotein (Gc), which is the primary target of neutralizing antibodies. In an animal model, the researchers identified a combination of two Gc-targeting antibodies that provided postexposure protection. They figured out the structure of the antigen-binding fragments of the Gc after it changed conformation into the trimeric postfusion form. The structures show how the antibodies collaborate to prevent membrane fusion.
