about.msg=Crystal structure of yeast fatty acid synthase
about.section=In the multifunction fungal fatty acid synthase (FAS), the acyl carrier protein (ACP) domain shuttles reaction intermediates covalently attached to its prosthetic phosphopantetheine group between the different enzymatic centres of the reaction cycle. The structure of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae FAS determined its ACP stalled at the active site of the ketoacyl synthase. The ACP contacts the base of the reaction chamber through conserved, which optimally position the ACP toward the catalytic cleft of ketoacyl synthase. The conformation of the prosthetic group suggests a switchblade mechanism for acyl chain delivery to the enzyme's active site.
