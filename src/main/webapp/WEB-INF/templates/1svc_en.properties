about.msg=Structure of the NF-kappa B p50
about.section=1SVC is a structure of a substantial portion of the human transcription factor NF-kappa B's p50 subunit linked to DNA as a homodimer. Two beta domains in the Rel-homology region grab DNA in the major groove, and both domains make contact with the DNA backbone. The specificity domain's amino-terminal area contains a recognition loop that interacts with DNA bases and the l-kappa B interaction site. These domains have folds that are similar to immunoglobin-like modules. The amino-terminal domain is likewise identical to p53's core domain.
