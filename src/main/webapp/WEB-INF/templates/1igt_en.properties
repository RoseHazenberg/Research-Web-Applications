about.msg=Structure of Immunoglobulin
about.section=1IGT is a structure of an intact, anti-canine lymphoma monoclonal antibody (Mab231). All antibody segments, including the hinge region and carbohydrate component, are visible in electron density maps. Hypervariable loops of both Fragment antigen-binding (Fabs) are involved in contacts with symmetry-related Fc segments at the CH2-CH3 switch junction. The hinge segment connecting Fabs with the Fc is quite extended and exhibits thermal factors indicative of a high degree of mobility. It consists of a well-defined upper hinge that partially maintains dyad symmetry and a reasonably rigid core bounded above and below bt fluid polypeptides that provide segmental flexibility. The structure represents the first visualization by X-ray analysis of a murine Fc segment, and its CH2 domains exhibit substantial rigid body conformational changes as an initial molecular replacement model. The detailed structure of the IgG and the distribution of the effector binding sites presented here appears consistent with effector activation mechanisms involving translocation and aggregation of the Fc following antigen binding by the Fabs.
