about.msg=Interact with a molecule by different movements.
about.section=This website shows a specified molecule, and through different movements, you can move the molecule. A molecule is entered at the input, which then shows a JSmol molecule of the specified file, a PDB file. The molecule can be moved using the leap motion, such as rotating and zooming in and out of the molecule.

what.msg=What is it?
leap_motion.msg=No controllers. No wearables. No touchscreens. Just natural interaction.
leap_motion.txt=The Leap Motion Controller is an optical hand tracking module that captures the movements of your hands with unparalleled accuracy. From XR to touchless kiosks, the Leap Motion Controller makes interaction with digital content natural and effortless. The Leap Motion is used to move the molecule through hand movements, such as turning and resizing the molecule.
jsmol.msg=Create a molecule that moves.
jsmol.txt=JSmol is a JavaScript framework that allows web developers to create pages that utilize either Java or HTML5 (no Java) at will. This enables Jmol to display interactive 3D molecular structures on devices that do not have Java installed, or for which Java is not available (such as smartphones and some tablet computers, e.g. iPad) or has not been installed because of concerns for Java being a security threat. JSmol/HTML5 (no Java) is virtually identical to JSmol/Java rendering. The Java mode gives faster performance and smoother rotation than the HTML5 mode by a factor of 6 to 10, typically. In many cases, this is not noticeable. It is noticed with rending structures involving 20,000+ atoms or surface creation. Rendering in the HTML5 mode can be sped up substantially with the judicial use of PlatformSpeed.

about_us.section=We are two students, Rose Hazenberg and Akastia Christo, in our third year of BioInformatics at the Hanze University of Applied Science. We got an opportunity to make an interactive website for BioInformatics to get upcoming students to know more about the study.
