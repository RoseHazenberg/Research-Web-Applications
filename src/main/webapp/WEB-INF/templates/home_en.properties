about.msg=Interact with a molecule by different movements.
about.section=Through this website, it is possible to interact with a specified molecule. This interaction is made possible by various movements. Think, for example, of rotating and zooming in and out of a molecule. A molecule can be entered at the input, which then shows a JSmol molecule of the specified file, namely a pdb file. The molecule can then move using the leap motion. It is possible to interact using only your hands.

leap_motion.msg=No controllers. No wearables. No touchscreens. Just natural interaction.
leap_motion.txt=The leap motion is an optical hand-tracking module that records the movement of users' hands and fingers, allowing them to interact naturally with digital content, such as molecules on this website. Small, fast, and accurate, it can be used for productivity applications with computers, integrated into enterprise hardware solutions or displays, or linked to virtual/augmented reality headsets for AR/VR/XR prototyping, research, and development. The controller is capable of tracking hands within an interactive 3D zone extending 60cm or more, extending from the device in a 120 x 150° field of view. Leap Motion's software can distinguish and track 27 different hand elements, including bones and joints, even if they are hidden by other parts of the hand.
jsmol.msg=Create a molecule that moves.
jsmol.txt=JSmol is a part of Jmol and is a computer software for molecular modeling of chemical structures in 3D representation which can be used as a teaching tool. JSmol is Jmol's HTML5 modality, which can be embedded in web pages. This enables Jmol to display interactive 3D molecular structures on devices that do not have Java installed, or for which Java is not available (such as smartphones and some tablets) or is not installed due to concerns that Java is a security threat. JSmol/HTML5 (no Java) is almost identical in appearance to JSmol/Java. Java mode gives faster performance and smoother rotation than HTML5 mode, usually by a factor of 6 to 10. In many cases, this is not noticeable. Where it is noticed is in rendering structures with more than 20,000 atoms or in creating surfaces.

about_us.section=We are two students, Rose Hazenberg and Akastia Christo, in our third year of Bioinformatics at the Hanze University of Applied Science. We got an opportunity to make an interactive website for Bioinformatics to get upcoming students to know more about the study and to give a better picture of the study.
