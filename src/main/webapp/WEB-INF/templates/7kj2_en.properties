about.msg=SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoprotein
about.section=The human angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE@) is a membrane-bound carboxypeptidase that forms a dimer and serves as the cellular receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). ACE2 is also a key negative regulator of the renin-angiotensin system that modulates vacular functions. The trimeric ACE2 variant has a binding affinity for the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, and its peptidase activity and the ability to block activation of angiontensin receptor type 1 in the renin-angiotensin system are preserved. The engineered ACE2 potently inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection in cell culture. This could suggest that the ACE2, an anti-SARS-CoV-2 agent, could be used for treating COVID-19.
