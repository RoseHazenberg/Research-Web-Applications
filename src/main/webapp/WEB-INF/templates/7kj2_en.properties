about.section=The human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) membrane-bound carboxypeptidase forms a dimer and the cellular receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). ACE2 is also a critical negative regulator of the renin-angiotensin system that modulates vascular functions. The trimeric ACE2 variant has a binding affinity for the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Its peptidase activity and the ability to block the activation of angiotensin receptor II type 1 in the renin-angiotensin system are preserved. The engineered ACE2 potently inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection in cell culture. This could suggest that the ACE2, an anti-SARS-CoV-2 agent, could treat COVID-19.
